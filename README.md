This is where I pretend to be good at algorithms and data structures.

Think of this repo as my digital gym membership – I *promise* I'm working out my brain here... regularly... definitely... 💪🧠

Whether you're here to judge my implementation of a linked list or watch me struggle with dynamic programming, welcome! Feel free to look around, but no warranties that anything actually works as intended.

**Motivation:** Leetcode nightmares and imposter syndrome

**Results:** TBD (check back never)
